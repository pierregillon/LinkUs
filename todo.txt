* or reset the asyncOperation buffer to 1024 after send. (because now, it can be use for a read.)
* catch exception in downloader/uploader and try to send message to client to close the file.
* Centralize socketAsyncOperation in a class to share it accross multiple SocketConnection? SocketAsyncOperationPool?
